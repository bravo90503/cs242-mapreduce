Compile, Package & Run!
Our project is setup, our code is in place; it’s now time to compile our project.

$ mvn clean install
Lots of downloading of dependencies and a bit of compilation go on . . . If all has gone to plan, you can now have a package to run. As usual, you’ll need a text file of words to count. I’ve popped one up on hdfs called “input.txt”.

$ hadoop jar target/wordcount-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar input.txt wcout
You should now have a map reduce job running!
