You can sign up here on our participant's page. We are also in need of native or fluent speakers so that everything is pronounced properly. You can sign up for the Pronunciation task force by adding your name as well as your languages of fluency to section 2.

        Problems  
        
         A code-change last week to fix a bug with Live Preview may have caused problems with some local gadgets and user-scripts. Any code with skin-specific behaviour for vector should be updated to also check for vector-2022. A code-snippet, global search, and example are available.
         
        Changes later this week  
        
          The new version of MediaWiki will be on test wikis and MediaWiki.org from 8 February. It will be on non-Wikipedia wikis and some Wikipedias from 9 February. It will be on all wikis from 10 February (calendar).
