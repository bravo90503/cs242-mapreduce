           This is a tracking category.
          It is used to build and maintain lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. 
          
           
            More information:
           
            
            
             This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference is set. 
             These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. 
             These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications).
             
           
          
        
       
       
        
      
       
        
         
         Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time.
        
       
       
      This category tracks tranclusions of Template:Blockquote that have no text given for quotation or use an equals sign in the argument of an unnamed parameter. It also tracks usage of |class=, |id=, |diff=, |4=, or |5=.
