             You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia.
             
            Editing from your IP address range (185.242.5.0/24) has been blocked (disabled) on all Wikimedia wikis until 20:14, 15 August 2023 by Martin Urbanec (meta.wikimedia.org) for the following reason:  
             
            
             No open proxies: please read the FAQ should you be affected
             
            This block began on 20:14, 15 August 2020 
            Your current IP address is 185.242.5.178. Please include all above details in any queries you make. 
            If you believe you were blocked by mistake, you can find additional information and instructions in the No open proxies global policy. Otherwise, to discuss the block post a request for review on Meta-Wiki or send an email to the stewards Volunteer Response Team queue at stewards@wikimedia.org including all above details.  
            
         
        
        
       
        
        
          You are currently unable to edit Wikipedia due to a block affecting this IP address.
         This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages.
        
         
        Most people who see this message have done nothing wrong. Some kinds of blocks restrict editing from specific service providers or telecom companies in response to recent abuse or vandalism, and affect other users who are unrelated to that abuse. See below if you do not believe you have done anything wrong.
         
        Editing from 185.242.4.0/22 has been blocked (disabled) by ‪ST47‬ for the following reason(s):  
         
          
          
           
          The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked because it is believed to be a web host provider or colocation provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts and colocation providers may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. 
          
           You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host or colocation provider because it hides your IP address, much like a proxy or VPN. 
           We recommend that you attempt to use another connection to edit. For example, if you use a proxy or VPN to connect to the internet, turn it off when editing Wikipedia. If you edit using a mobile connection, try using a Wi-Fi connection, and vice versa. If you have a Wikipedia account, please log in. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption. 
           If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: }. You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system. There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. 
           Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.  
          
          
         
        This block has been set to expire: 21:09, 18 June 2023.  
        
        Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page, and email administrators and other editors. 
        For information on how to proceed, first see the FAQ for blocked users and the guideline on block appeals. The guide to appealing blocks may also be helpful.

     ==Common subfields==
}
An advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established:&lt;ref name="staten"/&gt; "The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas
* a.	]
* b.	]
* c.	]
* d.	]
* e.	Interactive ]
* f.	]
* g.	]
* h.	] (cf ])
* i.	] or ]
* j.	] and ]"
* k. ]

There are other ways to identify subfields within LIS, for example bibliometric mapping and comparative studies of curricula.
Bibliometric maps of LIS have been produced by, among others, Vickery &amp; Vickery (1987, frontispiece),&lt;ref name="istp"/&gt; White &amp; McCain (1998),&lt;ref name="jouram"/&gt; Åström (2002),&lt;ref name="visual"/&gt; 2006) and Hassan-Montero &amp; Herrero-Solana (2007).&lt;ref name="visual22"/&gt; 
An example of a curriculum study is Kajberg &amp; Lørring, 2005.&lt;ref name="eurcur"/&gt; In this publication are the following data reported (p 234):
"Degree of overlap of the ten curricular themes with subject areas in the current curricula of responding LIS schools
* ] and ] 100%
* ] and promotion 96%
* ] 86%
* ] 82%
* ] and learning 76%
* Library and society in a historical perspective (]) 66%
*  The ]: Barriers to the ] 64%
* ] and digitisation of the cultural heritage (]) 62%
* The library in the multi-cultural information society: International and intercultural communication 42%
* Mediation of culture in a special European context 26% "

There is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.&lt;ref name="ieos"/&gt;
