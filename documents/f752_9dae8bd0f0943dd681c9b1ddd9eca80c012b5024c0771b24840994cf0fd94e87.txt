      A graphic organizer, also known as a knowledge map, concept map, story map, cognitive organizer, advance organizer, or concept diagram is a pedagogical tool that uses visual symbols to express knowledge and concepts through relationships between them. The main purpose of a graphic organizer is to provide a visual aid to facilitate learning and instruction.

      Enhancing students' skills 
      A review study concluded that using graphic organizers improves student performance in the following areas:  
      
       
        Retention
        
       
        Students remember information better and can better recall it when it is represented and learned both visually and verbally.
       
       
      
       
        Reading comprehension
        
       
        The use of graphic organizers helps improving the reading comprehension of students.
       
       
      
       
        Student achievement
        
       
        Students with and without learning disabilities improve achievement across content areas and grade levels.
       
       
      
       
        Thinking and learning skills; critical thinking
        
       
        When students develop and use a graphic organizer their higher order thinking and critical thinking skills are enhanced.
