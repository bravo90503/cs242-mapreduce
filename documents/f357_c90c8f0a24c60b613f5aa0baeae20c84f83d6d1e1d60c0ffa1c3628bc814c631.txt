      iSchools organization 
      The iSchools organization reflects a consortium of over 100 information schools across the globe. iSchools promote an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the opportunities and challenges of information management, with a core commitment to concepts like universal access and user-centered organization of information. The field is concerned broadly with questions of design and preservation across information spaces, from digital and virtual spaces such as online communities, social networking, the World Wide Web, and databases to physical spaces such as libraries, museums, collections, and other repositories. "School of Information", "Department of Information Studies", or "Information Department" are often the names of the participating organizations. 
      Degree programs at iSchools include course offerings in areas such as information architecture, design, policy, and economics; knowledge management, user experience design, and usability; preservation and conservation; librarianship and library administration; the sociology of information; and human-computer interaction and computer science.  
      Leadership 
      The executive committee of the iSchools is made up of the current chair (Sam Oh, SKKU, Korea), past chair (Michael Seadle, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Germany), and the chair elect (Gobinda Choudhury, Northumbria University, UK), plus representatives from the three regions (North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific). The current executive director is Michael Seadle.
