         This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages.
        
         
        Most people who see this message have done nothing wrong. Some kinds of blocks restrict editing from specific service providers or telecom companies in response to recent abuse or vandalism, and affect other users who are unrelated to that abuse. See below if you do not believe you have done anything wrong.
         
        Editing from 185.242.4.0/22 has been blocked (disabled) by ‪ST47‬ for the following reason(s):  
         
          
          
           
          The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked because it is believed to be a web host provider or colocation provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts and colocation providers may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. 
          
           You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host or colocation provider because it hides your IP address, much like a proxy or VPN. 
           We recommend that you attempt to use another connection to edit. For example, if you use a proxy or VPN to connect to the internet, turn it off when editing Wikipedia. If you edit using a mobile connection, try using a Wi-Fi connection, and vice versa. If you have a Wikipedia account, please log in. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption. 
           If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: }. You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system. There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. 
           Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests. Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator.

        Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page, and email administrators and other editors. 
        For information on how to proceed, first see the FAQ for blocked users and the guideline on block appeals. The guide to appealing blocks may also be helpful.

=== Scope and approach ===
Information science focuses on understanding ] from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of ] within that system. In this respect, one can see information science as a response to ], the belief that technology "develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available and the creativity of its developers. It must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many universities have entire colleges, departments or schools devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information-science scholars work in disciplines such as ], ], ], ], and ]. Several institutions have formed an I-School Caucus (see '']''), but numerous others besides these also have comprehensive information foci.

Within information science, current issues } include:

* ] for science
* ]
* The ]
* ]
* ] processes
* The ways people generate, use and find information

===Definitions===
The first known usage of the term "information science" was in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; An early definition of Information science (going back to 1968, the year when the ''American Documentation Institute'' renamed itself as the ''American Society for Information Science and Technology'') states:

:"Information science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization of information. This includes the investigation of information representations in both natural and artificial systems, the use of codes for efficient message transmission, and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems. It is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, management, and other similar fields. It has both a pure science component, which inquires into the subject without regard to its application, and an applied science component, which develops services and products." (Borko, 1968, p.3).&lt;ref&gt;Borko, H. (1968). Information science: What is it? ''American Documentation'' 19(1), 3¬5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related terms====
Some authors use ] as a synonym for ''information science''. This is especially true when related to the concept developed by ] and other Soviet authors in the mid-1960s. The Mikhailov school saw informatics as a discipline related to the study of scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;
Informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving and ] nature of the field. Definitions reliant on the nature of the tools used for deriving meaningful information from data are emerging in Informatics academic programs.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people} note that much of what is called "Informatics" today was once called "Information Science" – at least in fields such as Medical Informatics. For example, when library scientists began also to use the phrase "Information Science" to refer to their work, the term "informatics" emerged:

* in the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science
* in Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems

Another term discussed as a synonym for "information studies" is "]". ]'s ''Information Systems'' (1973) placed information systems within IS.&lt;ref&gt;Vickery; B. C. (1973). Information Systems. London: Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis, Allen, &amp; Wilson (1999), on the other hand, provided a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between two ''different'' fields: "information science" and "information systems".&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, D., Allen, D. and Wilson, T. 1999. . JASIS 50(12):1095–1107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of information===
}

Philosophy of information studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection of ], ], ], and ]. It includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of ], including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences, as well as the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems.&lt;ref&gt;Luciano Floridi,  },   ''Metaphilosophy'', 2002, (33), 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontology ===
}

In science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a ], and the relationships between those concepts.  It can be used to ] about the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain.

More specifically, an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation".&lt;ref name="TRG93"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; An ontology renders shared ] and ] which models a domain with the definition of objects and/or concepts and their properties and relations.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in ], the ], ], ], ], ], ], and ] as a form of ] about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an ].
