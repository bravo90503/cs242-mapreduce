      International studies (IS) is the study of international relations from a multidisciplinary perspective. Predominant topics are global politics, international economics and law, but also elements such as anthropology, ethnology, sociology, cultural studies and History, which is used to scientifically study the relations between sovereign nations states existing in a complex network of political alliances, diplomacy, trade networks, culture, history and legal institutions. The term international studies is used to demarcate the discipline from international relations, which is often studied as simply a subdiscipline of political science. International studies may, due to its focus on multiple academic disciplines, be studied over several university departments, or as a specialised study programme within a single department.
