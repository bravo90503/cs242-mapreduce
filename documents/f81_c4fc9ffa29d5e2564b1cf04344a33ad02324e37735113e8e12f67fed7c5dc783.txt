      The (standard) Boolean model of information retrieval (BIR) is a classical information retrieval (IR) model and, at the same time, the first and most-adopted one. It is used by many IR systems to this day. The BIR is based on Boolean logic and classical set theory in that both the documents to be searched and the user's query are conceived as sets of terms (a bag-of-words model). Retrieval is based on whether or not the documents contain the query terms.

         . 
      Obviously, if there is more than one document with the same representation, every such document is retrieved. Such documents are indistinguishable in the BIR (in other words, equivalent).  
      Advantages 
      
       Clean formalism 
       Easy to implement 
       Intuitive concept 
       If the resulting document set is either too small or too big, it is directly clear which operators will produce respectively a bigger or smaller set. 
       It gives (expert) users a sense of control over the system. It is immediately clear why a document has been retrieved given a query.
       
      Disadvantages 
      
       Exact matching may retrieve too few or too many documents 
       Hard to translate a query into a Boolean expression 
       All terms are equally weighted 
       More like data retrieval than information retrieval 
       Retrieval based on binary decision criteria with no notion of partial matching 
       No ranking of the documents is provided (absence of a grading scale) 
       Information need has to be translated into a Boolean expression, which most users find awkward 
       The Boolean queries formulated by the users are most often too simplistic 
       The model frequently returns either too few or too many documents in response to a user query
       
      Data structures and algorithms 
      From a pure formal mathematical point of view, the BIR is straightforward. From a practical point of view, however, several further problems should be solved that relate to algorithms and data structures, such as, for example, the choice of terms (manual or automatic selection or both), stemming, hash tables, inverted file structure, and so on.  
      Hash sets 
      
      
       Main article: feature hashing
       
      Another possibility is to use hash sets. Each document is represented by a hash table which contains every single term of that document. Since hash table size increases and decreases in real time with the addition and removal of terms, each document will occupy much less space in memory. However, it will have a slowdown in performance because the operations are more complex than with bit vectors. On the worst-case performance can degrade from O(n) to O(n2). On the average case, the performance slowdown will not be that much worse than bit vectors and the space usage is much more efficient.  
      Signature file 
      Each document can be summarized by Bloom filter representing the set of words in that document, stored in a fixed-length bitstring, called a signature. The signature file contains one such superimposed code bitstring for every document in the collection. Each query can also be summarized by a Bloom filter representing the set of words in the query, stored in a bitstring of the same fixed length. The query bitstring is tested against each signature. 
      The signature file approached is used in BitFunnel.  
      Inverted file 
      
      
       Main article: inverted index
       
      An inverted index file contains two parts: a vocabulary containing all the terms used in the collection, and for each distinct term an inverted index that lists every document that mentions that term.
