             Researchers from different disciplines may choose to work together for a variety of reasons. Their complementary skills may enable problems to be solved more quickly; they may be better placed to tackle a multi-faceted problem; or they may wish to learn new skills and expand their methodological range. In other cases, research funders may require such an approach. Alternatively, the complexity or high cost of the research may mean that working together is the only viable option if the research…&nbsp;Expand
