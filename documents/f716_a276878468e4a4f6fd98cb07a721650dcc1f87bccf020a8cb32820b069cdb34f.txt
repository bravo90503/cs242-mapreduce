      Biography 
      Johnson received his BS in Physics in 1982 from the Wright State University, and his MS in Physics in 1984, and his PhD in Medical Biophysics in 1990, both from the University of Utah, in Salt Lake City. 
      From 1985 - 1989, Johnson was an Assistant Professor of Physics at Westminster College (Utah). In 1990, Johnson joined the University of Utah, first as a Research Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at the Nora Eccles Harrison Cardiovascular Research and Training Institute (CVRTI) and has held faculty positions in the Departments of Mathematics, Bioengineering, Physics, and Computer Science. In 1996 he was appointed Associate Professor and Associate Chairman in the Department of Computer Science. In 2003, Johnson was promoted to the rank of Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah and served as the Director of the University of Utah School of Computing. Johnson served as the Director of the ACCESS Program for Women in Science and Mathematics between 1993-1993 and a member of the ACCESS Faculty until 2003. In 1999 he founded and Directed the Engineering Scholars Program until 2004. 
      In 1992 Johnson founded the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) research group at the University of Utah, which has since grown to become the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute (SCI Institute) employing over 200 faculty, staff, and students. Johnson serves on several international journal editorial boards, as well as on advisory boards to several national and international research centers. In 2013 Professor Johnson was elected to the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association (CRA) and in 2012 Johnson was selected as a member of the Executive Committee of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics. 
      Johnson serves on several international journal editorial boards, as well as on advisory boards to several national and international research centers.
