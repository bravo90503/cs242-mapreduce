      This category contains articles which have been proposed for splitting into multiple articles. This is usually done when an article is becoming too long or covers too broad a subject. Wikipedia:Summary style, Wikipedia:Article size, Wikipedia:Splitting, Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia, Wikipedia:Content forking and Wikipedia:Merging are relevant guidelines to consider when deciding if an article is to split, and the appropriate ways of doing a split. Wikipedia:Disambiguation gives advice on creating "disambiguation" pages to distinguish similarly-named articles. Use (}, } and } to add articles to this category.
