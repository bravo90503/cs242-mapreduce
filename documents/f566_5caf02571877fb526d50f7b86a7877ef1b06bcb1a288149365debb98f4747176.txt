      Should history be included here? I've removed it, because I would've thought it fell better in the humanities category - but please add again if you disagree. The lines between the two are certainly fuzzy. Wikidea 09:21, 30 September 2007 (UTC)

      The policy WP:SELF is referring to the template/category "namespace" not "content" (e.g. see these bot edits navigation, -related). By the way just about all abstract or in-progress template uses these links. 
      Usually (Portal, Index, Category, Stubs Task Force, Glossary/Appendix, Discussion). This method actually make wikipedia editing a lot faster, since the current wikipedia's academic disciplines is a biased article (e.g. scientific method only)  
      
       
        however philosophical method, liberal arts, thousand university schools, faculty classification system, vocational system of trades, school of thought are more widely used.
