      History 
      The first medical journals were general medical journals, and were established in the late 18th century; specialty-specific medical journals were first introduced in the early 20th century. The first medical journal to be published in the United Kingdom was  Medical Essays and Observations, established in 1731 and published in Edinburgh; the first to be published in the United States was The Medical Repository, established in 1797.  
      Criticisms 
      Richard Smith, the former editor of the medical journal the BMJ, has been critical of many of the aspects of modern-day medical journal publishing.
