      The Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) is a commercial citation index product of Clarivate Analytics. It was originally developed by the Institute for Scientific Information from the Science Citation Index. The Social Sciences Citation Index is a multidisciplinary index and indexes over 3,000 social sciences journals – 1985 to present.

      Overview 
      The SSCI citation database covers some 3,000 academic journals in the social sciences across more than 50 disciplines. It is made available online through the Web of Science service for a fee. The database records which articles are cited by other articles. 
      The Master Journal List provides users with the ability to search for journals that have been indexed.  
      Criticism 
      Philip Altbach has criticised the Social Sciences Citation Index of favouring English-language journals generally and American journals specifically, while greatly underrepresenting journals in non-English languages.
