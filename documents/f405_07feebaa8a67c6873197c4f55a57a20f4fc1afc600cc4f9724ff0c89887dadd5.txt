===Early beginnings===
], a German ] who wrote primarily in Latin and French. His fields of study were ], ], ].]]
Information science, in studying the collection, ], manipulation, storage, ] and dissemination of ] has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the ] with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, John Willis. ''The Care Of Books: An Essay On The Development Of Libraries And Their Fittings, From The Earliest Times To The End Of The Eighteenth Century.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the ], beginning with publication of the first issues of ''],'' generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).

The ] of science occurred throughout the 18th century. In 1731, ] established the ], the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of ], and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Korty, Margaret Barton. "Benjamin Franklin and Eighteenth Century American Libraries." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' December vol. 55.9 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Franklin invested a town in ] with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first ] of the ].&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; Academie de Chirurgia (]) published ''Memoires pour les Chirurgiens'', generally considered to be the first ], in 1736. The ], patterned on the ] (]), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded, ] developed the concept of ] for use in mass printing work in ] in 1796.

===19th century===
]]]
By the 19th century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801, ] invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of "memory storage of patterns" system.&lt;ref&gt;Reichman, F. (1961). Notched Cards. In R. Shaw (Ed.), The state of the library art (Volume 4, Part 1, pp. 11–55). New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers, The State University, Graduate School of Library Service&lt;/ref&gt; As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; ] developed his "difference engine," the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his "analytical engine” by 1834. By 1843 ] developed the rotary press, and in 1844 ] sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins the ''Index to Periodical Literature,'' the first general periodical literature index in the US.

In 1854 ] published ''An Investigation into Laws of Thought...,'' which lays the foundations for ], which is later used in ].&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress did not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants returned home with ]'s outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1865, the ] began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the ''International Catalogue of Scientific Papers'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the Royal Society began publication of its ''Catalogue of Papers'' in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the ]. By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875 ] was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; ] and ] invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the ] was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879 ''Index Medicus'' was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with ] as librarian, and later the library issues ''Index Catalogue,'' which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Schullian, D. M., &amp; Rogers, F. B. (1958). The National Library of Medicine. I. Library Quarterly, 28(1), 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===European documentation===

The discipline of '']'', which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th century in Europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Many information science historians cite ] and ] as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Rayward, W. B. (1994). International federation for information and documentation. In W. A. Wiegand, &amp; D. G. David Jr. (Eds.), The encyclopedia of library history (pp. 290–294). New York: Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after the ], most notably ]. However, "information science" as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. ''Modern Invention of Information''. Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001: 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, "As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity – indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. ''Modern Invention of Information.'' Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001: 7&lt;/ref&gt;
Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the ] in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and ] that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global "information society". Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the ] and the ]. Otlet designed the ], based on ]’s decimal classification system.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Day, Ronald. ''Modern Invention of Information.'' Carbondale, Il.: Southern Illinois University Press, 2001:&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the ]. His vision of a great network of ] focused on ]s and included the notions of ]s, ], remote access, and ]s.

Otlet not only imagined that all the world's knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the ].

===Transition to modern information science===
], a famous information scientist, ca. 1940–1944]]
With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with other programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as ] and ] in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the ], and user-oriented services such as ] and ], were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous ] to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;
