      One title per line 
      I already changed the "list" to show only one title per line. Sorry for not discussing first. The reason why I changed it:  
      
       Where this template appeared, in an article, it took too much width of the article. 
       With one title per line it is easier readable.
       
      The only thing I did not know: how to adapt the width of the frame. I had expected, that the frame adapts itself that is: gets adapted automatically, but this did not happen. I don't mind, if someone who knows how to, does it. Otherwise: once I have studied Template:Sidebar, I shall do it. Steue (talk) 08:30, 18 May 2019 (UTC)
