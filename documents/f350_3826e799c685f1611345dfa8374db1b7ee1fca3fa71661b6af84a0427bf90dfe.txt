      Etymology 
      The English-language word commerce has been derived from the Latin word commercium, from com ("together") and merx ("merchandise").  
      History 
      
       
         
        
         
          
         The caduceus - used today as the symbol of commerce, and traditionally associated with the Roman god Mercury, patron of commerce, trickery and thieves.
        
       
       
      Historian  Peter Watson and Ramesh Manickam date the  history of long-distance commerce from circa 150,000 years ago. 
      In historic times, the introduction of currency as a standardized money facilitated the exchange of goods and services. 
      Banking systems developed in medieval Europe, facilitating financial transactions across national boundaries. Markets became a feature of town life, and were regulated by town authorities.
