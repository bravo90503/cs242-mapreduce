           This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
           
          
           This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set.
          
        
       
       
      This category contains all pages labeled with inline weasel word-related templates such as }, }, }, or }. It exists primarily for bot-based monitoring of articles containing weasel words. By-month categories are located in Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases. The key to improving weasel words in articles is to either: a) name a source for the opinion; or b) change any opinionated language to concrete facts. After making such changes, remove the template from the article.
