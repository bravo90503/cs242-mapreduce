             Abstract. The problem of audio information retrieval is familiar to anyone who has returned from vacation to find an answering machine full of messages. While there is not yet an “AltaVista” for the audio data type, many workers are finding ways to automatically locate, index, and browse audio using recent advances in speech recognition and machine listening. This paper reviews the state of the art in audio information retrieval, and presents recent advances in automatic speech recognition…&nbsp;Expand

              A novel method of automatically detecting and removing commercials is presented and shown to increase the performance of the system while also reducing the computational effort required, and a sophisticated large vocabulary speech recogniser which produces high-quality transcriptions of the audio and a window-based retrieval system with post-retrieval merging are described.

              It is said that content-based retrieval system permits more tolerance towards erroneous queries, as in these systems queries contain more errors; so for such search keys similarity search based on approximate matching produce batter results compare to exact matching.
