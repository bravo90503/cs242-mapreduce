        Most people who see this message have done nothing wrong.

          The IP address that you are currently using has been blocked because it is believed to be a web host provider or colocation provider. To prevent abuse, web hosts and colocation providers may be blocked from editing Wikipedia. 
          
           You will not be able to edit Wikipedia using a web host or colocation provider because it hides your IP address, much like a proxy or VPN. 
           We recommend that you attempt to use another connection to edit. For example, if you use a proxy or VPN to connect to the internet, turn it off when editing Wikipedia. If you edit using a mobile connection, try using a Wi-Fi connection, and vice versa. If you have a Wikipedia account, please log in. If you do not have any other way to edit Wikipedia, you will need to request an IP block exemption. 
           If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page: }. You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system. There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. 
           Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests.

'''Information retrieval''' ('''IR''') in ] and ] is the process of obtaining ] resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources.  Searches can be based on ] or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for the ] that describes data, and for ] of texts, images or sounds.

Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called ]. An IR system is a software system that provides access to books, journals and other documents; stores and manages those documents. ]s are the most visible IR applications.

== Overview ==
An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of ].

An object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or ]. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ] of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. and Rieh, S. (2010)  }. Journal of the American Society for Information Sciences and Technology. 61(8), 1517-1534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the ] the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,&lt;ref name=goodron2000&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; audio,&lt;ref name=Foote99&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; ]&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or ].

Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.&lt;ref name="Frakes1992"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
}
The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article '']'' by ] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Singhal2001"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; It would appear that Bush was inspired by patents for a 'statistical machine' - filed by ] in the 1920s and '30s - that searched for documents stored on film.&lt;ref name="Sanderson2012"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; The first description of a computer searching for information was described by Holmstrom in 1948,&lt;ref name="Holmstrom1948"&gt;}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing an early mention of the ] computer. Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy, ]. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by ] at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small ] such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).&lt;ref name="Singhal2001" /&gt; Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.

In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the ] (NIST), cosponsored the ] (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that ] to huge corpora. The introduction of ]s has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.

== Model types ==
], original source ).]]
For effectively retrieving relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.

=== First dimension: mathematical basis ===
* ''Set-theoretic'' models represent documents as ]s of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:
** ]
** ]
** ]
* ''Algebraic models'' represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.
** ]
** ]
** ]
** ]
** ] a.k.a. ]
* ''Probabilistic models'' treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like the ] are often used in these models.
** ]
** ] on which is based the ] relevance function
** ]
** ]s
** ]
** ]
* ''Feature-based retrieval models'' view documents as vectors of values of ''feature functions'' (or just ''features'') and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by ] methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature.

=== Second dimension: properties of the model ===
* ''Models without term-interdependencies'' treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the ] assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an ] assumption for term variables.
* ''Models with immanent term interdependencies'' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by ]) from the ] of those terms in the whole set of documents.
* ''Models with transcendent term interdependencies'' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They rely an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example, a human or sophisticated algorithms.)

== } Performance and correctness measures ==
}
The evaluation of an information retrieval system' is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for ]} or top-k retrieval, include ]. All measures assume a ] notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice, queries may be ] and there may be different shades of relevancy.
