       American information technology journal
       
      The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology was an annual review journal published from 1966 to 2011. It was established in 1965 by the American Documentation Institute and the National Science Foundation, at the request of Helen Brownson. It published review articles rather than empirical research articles. Its last (2010) impact factor was 2.000. It was for 45 years "the main forum for scholarly review articles in information science."
