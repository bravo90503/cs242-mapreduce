           Melville Fuller (February 11, 1833&nbsp;– July 4, 1910) was the eighth chief justice of the United States. Born in Augusta, Maine, he graduated from Bowdoin College and practiced law in Chicago. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Supreme Court. Fuller gained a reputation for collegiality and competent administrative skills. His jurisprudence was staunchly conservative: he favored free enterprise and opposed broad federal power. Fuller wrote the majority opinion in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co., which held that the federal income tax was unconstitutional. He joined the majority opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld state-mandated racial segregation, and in Lochner v. New York, which struck down economic regulations on the grounds that they violated the freedom of contract. Many of his decisions were later overruled, and the majority of scholars have been critical of the Fuller Court's jurisprudence. He served as chief justice until his death in 1910.

         The alumni of Jesus College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England, include politicians, lawyers, bishops, poets, and academics. Some went on to become fellows of the college; fourteen students later became principals of the college. Jesus College was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (pictured) at the request of the Welsh clergyman Hugh Price, who was Treasurer of St&nbsp;Davids Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. From the world of politics, the college's alumni include two prime ministers (Harold Wilson of the United Kingdom and Kevin Rudd of Australia), Jamaica's chief minister and first premier (Norman Washington Manley), and a speaker of the House of Commons (Sir William Williams). The list of lawyers include one lord chancellor (Lord Sankey) and one law lord (Lord du Parcq). The list of clergy includes three archbishops of Wales (A.&nbsp;G. Edwards, Glyn Simon and Gwilym Williams). (Full&nbsp;list...)

             The soft-plumaged petrel (Pterodroma mollis) is a species of seabird in the family Procellariidae, found in the Southern Hemisphere. The species is known to breed on Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island, the Prince Edward Islands, the Crozet Islands, Macquarie Island and the Antipodes Islands of New Zealand. At other times of year, the petrel disperses more widely; this light-morph petrel was photographed at Eaglehawk Neck, east of the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania, Australia.
