       The Wikipedia Library is an open research hub, a place for active Wikipedia editors to gain access to the vital reliable sources that they need to do their work and to be supported in using those resources to improve the encyclopedia. We aim to make access and use of sources free, easy, collaborative and efficient. 
       The Wikipedia Library is run by a team of Wikimedia Foundation staff and global volunteers.
