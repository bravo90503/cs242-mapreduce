      Evaluation measures for an information retrieval system are used to assess how well the search results satisfied the user's query intent. Such metrics are often split into kinds: online metrics look at users' interactions with the search system, while offline metrics measure relevance, in other words how likely each result, or search engine results page (SERP) page as a whole, is to meet the information needs of the user.

      Online metrics 
      Online metrics are generally created from search logs. The metrics are often used to determine the success of an A/B test.  
      Session abandonment rate 
      Session abandonment rate is a ratio of search sessions which do not result in a click.  
      Click-through rate 
      Click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. It is commonly used to measure the success of an online advertising campaign for a particular website as well as the effectiveness of email campaigns.  
      Session success rate 
      Session success rate measures the ratio of user sessions that lead to a success. Defining "success" is often dependent on context, but for search a successful result is often measured using dwell time as a primary factor along with secondary user interaction, for instance, the user copying the result URL is considered a successful result, as is copy/pasting from the snippet.  
      Zero result rate 
      Zero result rate (ZRR) is the ratio of Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) which returned with zero results. The metric either indicates a recall issue, or that the information being searched for is not in the index.  
      Offline metrics 
      Offline metrics are generally created from relevance judgment sessions where the judges score the quality of the search results. Both binary (relevant/non-relevant) and multi-level (e.g., relevance from 0 to 5) scales can be used to score each document returned in response to a query. In practice, queries may be ill-posed, and there may be different shades of relevance. For instance, there is ambiguity in the query "mars": the judge does not know if the user is searching for the planet Mars, the Mars chocolate bar, or the singer Bruno Mars.

      Precision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are relevant to the user's information need.

      In binary classification, precision is analogous to positive predictive value. Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated considering only the topmost results returned by the system using Precision@k. 
      Note that the meaning and usage of "precision" in the field of information retrieval differs from the definition of accuracy and precision within other branches of science and statistics.

      In binary classification, recall is often called sensitivity. So it can be looked at as the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query. 
      It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore, recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision.  
      Fall-out 
      The proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available:

      It is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query.

      F-measure can be a better single metric when compared to precision and recall; both precision and recall give different information that can complement each other when combined. If one of them excels more than the other, F-measure will reflect it.  
      Average precision 
      Precision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision

          function by assuming a particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision values. For example, a binormal precision-recall curve can be obtained by assuming decision values in both classes to follow a Gaussian distribution.  
      Precision at k 
      For modern (web-scale) information retrieval, recall is no longer a meaningful metric, as many queries have thousands of relevant documents, and few users will be interested in reading all of them. Precision at k documents (P@k) is still a useful metric (e.g., P@10 or "Precision at 10" corresponds to the number of relevant results among the top 10 retrieved documents), but fails to take into account the positions of the relevant documents among the top k. Another shortcoming is that on a query with fewer relevant results than k, even a perfect system will have a score less than 1. It is easier to score manually since only the top k results need to be examined to determine if they are relevant or not.  
      R-precision 
      R-precision requires knowing all documents that are relevant to a query. The number of relevant documents,

         , is used as the cutoff for calculation, and this varies from query to query. For example, if there are 15 documents relevant to "red" in a corpus (R=15), R-precision for "red" looks at the top 15 documents returned, counts the number that are relevant 
           
            
             
             
              r
              
             
            
           
            
            
           
          turns that into a relevancy fraction:

         . 
      R-Precision is equal to recall at the R-th position. 
      Empirically, this measure is often highly correlated to mean average precision.  
      Mean average precision 
      Mean average precision (MAP) for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query.

      DCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result. 
      The DCG accumulated at a particular rank position

      Since result set may vary in size among different queries or systems, to compare performances the normalised version of DCG uses an ideal DCG. To this end, it sorts documents of a result list by relevance, producing an ideal DCG at position p (

          producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable.  
      Other measures 
      
       Mean reciprocal rank 
       Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 
       bpref - a summation-based measure of how many relevant documents are ranked before irrelevant documents 
       GMAP - geometric mean of (per-topic) average precision 
       Measures based on marginal relevance and document diversity - see Relevance (information retrieval) §&nbsp;Problems and alternatives 
       Measures of both relevance and credibility (for fake news in search results)
       
      Visualization 
      Visualizations of information retrieval performance include:  
      
       Graphs which chart precision on one axis and recall on the other 
       Histograms of average precision over various topics 
       Receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve) 
       Confusion matrix
       
      Non-metrics 
      Top queries list 
      Top queries is noting the most common queries over a fixed amount of time. The top queries list assists in knowing the style of queries entered by users.  
      Non-relevance metrics 
      Queries per time 
      Measuring how many queries are performed on the search system per (month/day/hour/minute/sec) tracks the utilization of the search system. It can be used for diagnostics to indicate an unexpected spike in queries, or simply as a baseline when comparing with other metrics, like query latency. For example, a spike in query traffic, may be used to explain a spike in query latency.
