              For USAL authors as a group, publication productivity, the proportion of peer-reviewed articles contributed to the LIS literature, and sole-authorship declined, and among USALs who did publish, productivity patterns remained similar over twenty years, with a slight increase in the percentage ofUSAL authors who published three or more articles in five years.

              Lower ranks of typical LIS journals affect research rewards for LIS researchers when JCR impact factors are emphasized, and 30 journals with a weak association to LIS research substantially explained the findings and tended to have higher impact factors.

              For USAL authors as a group, publication productivity, the proportion of peer-reviewed articles contributed to the LIS literature, and sole-authorship declined, and among USALs who did publish, productivity patterns remained similar over twenty years, with a slight increase in the percentage ofUSAL authors who published three or more articles in five years.
