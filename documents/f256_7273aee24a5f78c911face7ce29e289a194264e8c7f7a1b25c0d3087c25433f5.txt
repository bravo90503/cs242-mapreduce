         How to provide a link to a specific Google Search
         
        On talk pages, it may be useful to provide a google search link directly in a discussion of a topic's notability or in debates about which name for a subject is the most common. The Wikimedia software that powers Wikipedia lets you make links to Google by including google: as the prefix for the link, like this:  
        
         
          ].
         
         
        Which looks like this:  
        
         
          google:Tipster
         
         
        Note: It is important not to use spaces in the search. To add more parameters to the search, separate them by a plus sign, +. For a phrase search, use a hyphen (minus sign), -, between each word. E.g. to search for "Tip of the day", use Tip-of-the-day. 
        To provide a link to a Wikipedia-specific search, include in the google-link +site:en.wikipedia.org (no spaces before or after), like this:  
        
         
          ].
         
         
        Which looks like this:  
        
         
          google:Tip-of-the-day+site:en.wikipedia.org
         
         
        To clean up the link so that only the part you want to show is presented, use the pipe, like this:  
        
         
          ]
         
         
        Which makes it look like this:  
        
         
          "Tip of the day"
