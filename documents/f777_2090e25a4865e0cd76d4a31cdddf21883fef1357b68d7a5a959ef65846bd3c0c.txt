           This is a maintenance category, used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project. It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.
           
          
           This is a hidden category. It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (appearance → show hidden categories) is set.
          
        
       
       
      Articles in category contain all recorded statements that may become dated. The statements may need to be updated, removed or edited for perspective. Articles containing older statements are more likely to be dated. This is not a backlog; not all articles included in this category will need updating at this point in time. See also Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements which contains potentially dated statements ordered by originating date. Use } to mark all individual statements that may become dated, this will automatically add them to the appropriate categories. Wherever possible, use } to mark exactly when statements will need updating in addition to using }. So that articles don't remain in this category too long, a suggestion is made to work on articles beginning with a certain letter. The letter is changed daily. 
      The current focus is on articles beginning with: O.
