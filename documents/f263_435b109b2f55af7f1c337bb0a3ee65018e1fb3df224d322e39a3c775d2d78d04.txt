         Madeley Old Hall
        
       
       
      Madeley Old Hall is a black and white Elizabethan house, now a small hotel, in the village of Madeley in Staffordshire, England. It stands in 2 acres of landscaped gardens and is a Grade II* listed building. 
      Built in the late 1500s, it is a timber-framed building with plaster infill standing on a sandstone plinth, originally with a cruciform floor-plan. Across the front gable of the house is carved the warning "WALLK KNAVE. WHAT LOOKEST AT". 
      The property was acquired in 2007 by Gary and Simon White and run as a country house hotel. It is also licensed for weddings.
