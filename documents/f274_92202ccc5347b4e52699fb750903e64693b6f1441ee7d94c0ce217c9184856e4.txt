     IMPORTANT NOTE: Most educators and professionals do not consider it appropriate to use tertiary sources such as encyclopedias as a sole source for any information—citing an encyclopedia as an important reference in footnotes or bibliographies may result in censure or a failing grade. Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research. 
     As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in Wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.

      When using the LaTeX package url (\usepackage somewhere in the preamble), which tends to give much more nicely formatted web addresses, the following may be preferred:  
        @misc{ enwiki:1069930871,
    author = "",
    title = "Information retrieval ---  The Free Encyclopedia",
    year = "2022",
