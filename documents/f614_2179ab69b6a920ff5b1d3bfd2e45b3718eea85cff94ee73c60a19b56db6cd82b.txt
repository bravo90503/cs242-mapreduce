    LIBRES EDITORIAL 
    &nbsp; 
    This issue of LIBRES contains 4 papers, the first of which, by Harald Jele, has been through the LIBRES refereeing process.&nbsp; The remaining three papers were amongst a number given at a recent workshop I attended: Workshop on Global Collaboration of Information Schools&nbsp; http://www.cisap.asia/IFLA2013/index.html&nbsp;&nbsp; held before the IFLA 2013 Singapore conference.&nbsp; &nbsp;I approached the workshop organisers, CiSAP&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.cisap.asia/ and was granted permission to reprint them in LIBRES, in the interests of promoting a research approach to workshop and conference papers.&nbsp;  
    In closing I would like to bid you farewell as the Editor-in-Chief of LIBRES.&nbsp; I retired from academia in March 2013 and decided to also hand over the baton for LIBRES.&nbsp; I am very pleased to advise that my colleague from Singapore, Associate Professor Christopher Khoo from the Division of Information Studies, Wee Kim Wee School of Communication &amp; Information, Nanyang Technological University will be assuming the position for and from the next issue in March 2014.&nbsp; Thank you so much Chris for agreeing to carry on the work of this important open access journal in library and information studies/science. 
    Dr Kerry Smith, FALIA Associate Professor (retired) Editor-in-Chief LIBRES&nbsp; http//libres.curtin.edu.au
